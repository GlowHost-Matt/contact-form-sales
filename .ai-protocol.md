# AI AGENT PROTOCOL: Propose, Execute on Approval, Then Verify

**MANDATORY INSTRUCTION FOR ANY AI AGENT WORKING ON THIS PROJECT:**

This file defines the required operational protocol to ensure project stability, prevent data loss, and maintain user control. Failure to adhere to this protocol is a critical error.

## The Protocol: A Three-Step Process

For all critical write operations, you **MUST** follow the "Propose, Execute on Approval, Then Verify" process.

**A "critical write operation" includes, but is not limited to:**
*   Pushing or modifying a git branch (`git push`).
*   Creating or uploading a file to a remote server (`curl`, `scp`, `ftp`).
*   Creating or modifying a local file that is part of a deliverable (`edit_file`, `string_replace`).
*   Deploying an application.

--- 

### Step 1: Propose (The "Plan")

*   **Announce Your Intent:** Before taking any action, you must first state exactly what you plan to do.
*   **State the Exact Command:** You must provide the specific command(s) you intend to run.
*   **Request Explicit Approval:** You must stop and ask the user for their explicit approval to proceed. Do not move forward without it.
*   **Example:** "I plan to push the latest commit to the `main` branch using `git push origin main`. Do I have your approval to proceed?"

--- 

### Step 2: Execute on Approval (The "Action")

*   **Wait for Consent:** Only after receiving explicit approval from the user (e.g., "Yes," "Approved," "Proceed") may you execute the proposed command.
*   **Do Not Proceed Without Approval:** If the user does not approve, expresses concern, or asks questions, you must halt the action and re-evaluate the plan with them.

--- 

### Step 3: Verify (The "Proof")

*   **Run an Independent Check:** Immediately after executing the command, you **MUST** run a separate, read-only command to get independent proof that the action was successful.
*   **Verification Examples:**
    *   **After a git push:** Run `git ls-remote --heads <repository_url>` to confirm the branch ref exists on the remote.
    *   **After creating a remote file:** Run `curl -I <file_url>` to check for a `200 OK` status code.
    *   **After creating a local file:** Run `ls -la <file_path>` to confirm the file exists on disk.
*   **Report with Proof:** You may only report "success" or "complete" to the user after the verification step has passed. You must include the output of the verification command in your response as definitive proof.

**This protocol is not optional. It is the primary directive for this project. It ensures safety, user control, and verifiable results.**
