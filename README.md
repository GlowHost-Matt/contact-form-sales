# GlowHost Contact Form System
Professional contact form with React.js frontend, admin interface, and comprehensive testing workflow.

## 🏗️ **MAJOR MILESTONE: Version 50 - Phase 5 Complete**

**🎯 MONUMENTAL ARCHITECTURAL CHANGE - MODULAR SYSTEM IMPLEMENTED**

**📅 Milestone Date:** August 8, 2025
**⚡ Status:** FULLY OPERATIONAL - ALL 38 TESTS PASSING

### 🔄 **CRITICAL REVERSION POINT:**
This version represents a stable, fully-tested state with major architectural improvements.
**If future changes break the system, revert to Version 50.**

See `PHASE-5-MILESTONE.md` for complete reversion instructions and verification details.

## 🚨 CRITICAL WORKFLOW RULE

**⚠️ AI MUST ALWAYS RUN AUTOMATED TESTS BEFORE ASKING HUMANS TO TEST**

```bash
# MANDATORY before any human verification:
bun run pre-human-test
```

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
bun install

# 2. Start development server
bun run start

# 3. BEFORE asking humans to test anything:
bun run pre-human-test
```

## 🔧 Development Workflow

### ✅ Proper Development Sequence:
1. **Make code changes**
2. **Run automated tests**: `bun run pre-human-test`
3. **Fix any failing tests**
4. **ONLY THEN** ask humans for UX verification

### ❌ Never Do This:
- Ask humans to test without running automated tests first
- Skip build verification
- Request manual testing of broken endpoints

## 📍 URLs

- **Development Dashboard**: http://localhost:3000
- **React.js Frontend**: http://localhost:3000/helpdesk/
- **Admin Interface**: http://localhost:3000/admin/ (admin/demo123)

## 🧪 Testing Commands

```bash
bun run test              # Run automated tests only
bun run pre-human-test    # Full pre-human verification (USE THIS)
bun run build-frontend    # Build verification only
bun run full-test         # Complete build + test suite
```

## 📋 Available Scripts

- `bun run start` - Start development server
- `bun run test` - Run automated test suite
- `bun run pre-human-test` - **MANDATORY** pre-human testing
- `bun run build-frontend` - Build React.js frontend
- `bun run full-test` - Build + test everything

## 🔒 Workflow Enforcement

This project includes automated workflow enforcement to ensure quality:
- **6 automated endpoint tests** must pass before human testing
- **Frontend build verification** ensures compilation success
- **Workflow compliance checking** prevents regression to bad practices

See `DEVELOPMENT-WORKFLOW.md` for complete workflow specification.
