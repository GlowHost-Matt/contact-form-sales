# Security Features TODO - Advanced Login Protection

## üîí **Advanced Security Features (Future Implementation)**

### **Login Security Enhancements:**
- [ ] **`login_attempts` column** - Track failed login attempts per user
- [ ] **`locked_until` column** - Temporary account lockout after failed attempts
- [ ] **Account lockout logic** - Lock account for 15-30 minutes after X failed attempts
- [ ] **Progressive delays** - Increase delay between attempts (1s, 2s, 4s, 8s...)
- [ ] **IP-based rate limiting** - Track attempts by IP address as well

### **Session Security:**
- [ ] **Session timeout** for admin accounts (30 minutes idle)
- [ ] **Secure session configuration** (httponly, secure, samesite)
- [ ] **Session regeneration** on login/privilege changes
- [ ] **Remember me** functionality with secure tokens

### **Password Security:**
- [ ] **Password strength requirements** - uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols
- [ ] **Password history** - prevent reusing last 5 passwords
- [ ] **Password expiration** - force password change every 90 days
- [ ] **Compromise detection** - check against known breached passwords

### **Two-Factor Authentication:**
- [ ] **TOTP support** (Google Authenticator, Authy)
- [ ] **Backup codes** for recovery
- [ ] **Email-based 2FA** as fallback option
- [ ] **Device remembering** for trusted devices

### **Audit & Monitoring:**
- [ ] **Login log table** - track all login attempts (success/failure)
- [ ] **Admin action logging** - track all admin operations
- [ ] **Email alerts** for suspicious login activity
- [ ] **Dashboard security widgets** - recent logins, failed attempts

### **Account Management:**
- [ ] **Password reset via email** - secure token-based reset
- [ ] **Account recovery options** - backup email, security questions
- [ ] **Account verification** - email verification for new accounts
- [ ] **Account deactivation** - soft delete vs hard delete options

### **Additional Security Headers:**
- [ ] **Content Security Policy (CSP)**
- [ ] **X-Frame-Options** protection
- [ ] **CSRF tokens** on all admin forms
- [ ] **Input sanitization** and validation improvements

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **Implementation Priority:**

### **Phase 1 (High Priority):**
- Login attempts tracking and account lockout
- Session timeout and security configuration
- Basic audit logging

### **Phase 2 (Medium Priority):**
- Password strength requirements
- Two-factor authentication
- Email-based password reset

### **Phase 3 (Enhancement):**
- Advanced monitoring and alerts
- Device management
- Compromise detection

## üìù **Notes:**

- **Keep it optional** - Many of these features should be configurable
- **Performance impact** - Consider caching for rate limiting checks
- **User experience** - Balance security with usability
- **Documentation** - Provide clear setup instructions for each feature

**Current focus: Core functionality first, security enhancements later**
